What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It begins tracking any documents/files that are marked in the repository. Since Git is a 
sequence of code changes, this is the start of that sequence.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Staging directory is for storing files that have had changes made before committing them 
to the repo. I'm not quite sure the value, but maybe more will be covered?


This is a test for git commit
