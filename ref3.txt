When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Anytime a project is being worked on from more than one terminal. Ex: multiple engineers, multiple locations for the same engineer, or even anytime you want to back up a project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because Git might make set the remote repo as public when it is in a non-functioning state between logical updates. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used split repoâ€™s on git hub, clones are used to copy the files needed to start a repo on either github or local terminal, and branches are splits in commit chronology when working on multiple aspects of a code base simultaneously. 


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can use it while offline if you still want to investigate differences and or merge without internet later.
