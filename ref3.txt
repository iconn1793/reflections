When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Anytime a project is being worked on from more than one terminal. Ex: multiple engineers, multiple locations for the same engineer, or even anytime you want to back up a project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because Git might make set the remote repo as public when it is in a non-functioning state between logical updates.
